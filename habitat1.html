<h1>A herd of antelope moves slowly through the tall grass. Suddenly a cheetah leaps from its hiding place, and the animals zig and zag across the savanna. They make it to a small grove of scrubby trees, but they can’t let their guard down yet. It’s the end of the rainy season and the antelopes—like many animals on the grasslands—must leave their protected place and migrate across open grasslands to find water.</h1>

        <h2>Young African lions grow up in prides with between 3 and 40 other felines. Females usually live with the pride for life, but males often leave when they’re a few years old. A male lion's loud roar, usually heard after sunset, can carry as far as five miles (eight kilometers). </h2>
